### Day 5: May 4, Wednesday

### Day 7: May 6, Friday

### Day 8: May 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Ahoy! 🦜

After working on my website all day, I just fixed all previous bugs, and added a splash screen as well as some "interesting visual details" 🧑‍🎨

The only thing left is to build a project presentation page for Gengo Project 🐱🇯🇵

### Day 9: May 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Ahoy! 🦜

After setting up my custom domain in Netlify, as well as fixing some "small bugs" while building, I just deployed http://joeltorres.me and it's finally live! 👨‍💻

Of course, I still need to set up a case study page for Gengo App, but, it is alive!

### Day 13: May 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I spent a few hours designing the presentation page for Gengo on Adobe XD, as well as fixed an issue that didn't update the user profile picture on Gengo App.

**Thoughts**: After I started using PMD for analyzing my Java code, I found new ways to ensure my code is properly refactored, so it was a really productive day.
